# Game-Scripts
Some of the coding scripts I have made for my personal video game projects
Combat: A script I used for any character in a game prototype to allow them to deal and take damage. 
Player: The script put on the ninja character allowing for its movement, ability to dash, ability to grapple, and die
Shooter: The script that provides the mechanics and physics behind the grappler in the ninja game.
